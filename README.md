## üì≤ Installation

MWCamera is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'MWCamera'
```

## üåö Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.


## ü§ì How to use

Using MWCamera is very straight forward.

### ü§®üìù Prerequisites

If you didn't know, Apple requires the additon of the `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` keys to the info.plist of your application. Example:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>To Capture Photos and Videos</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>To Record Audio</string>
```


### ü•≥ Getting Started

If you install MWCamera from Cocoapods, be sure to import the module at the top of the file.

```swift
import MWCamera
```


To get started with MWCamera, subclass  `MWCameraViewController`.

```swift
class CameraViewController: MWCameraViewController
```

Then once you handle camera and microphone permissions you can now configure the AVCaptureSession by calling 

```swift
self.reconfigureSession()
```

After this feel free to start adding your own config to to the AVCaptureDevice like 

```swift
if let device = self?.captureDevice {
    do {
        try device.lockForConfiguration()
        if device.isFocusModeSupported(.continuousAutoFocus) {
            device.focusMode = .continuousAutoFocus
        }

        if device.isSmoothAutoFocusSupported {
            device.isSmoothAutoFocusEnabled = true
        }

        if device.isExposureModeSupported(.continuousAutoExposure) {
            device.exposureMode = .continuousAutoExposure
        }

        if device.isWhiteBalanceModeSupported(.continuousAutoWhiteBalance) {
            device.whiteBalanceMode = .continuousAutoWhiteBalance
        }

        if device.isLowLightBoostSupported {
            device.automaticallyEnablesLowLightBoostWhenAvailable = true
        }

        device.unlockForConfiguration()
    } catch {
        print("[mwCamera]: Error locking configuration")
    }
}
```

Then afterwords call

```swift
self.beginSession()
```

And that's all to get your camera session up and running! üí™üèæ

Also `self.reconfigureSession()` does not add audio input and output. These are added to the session right before recording then removed right after in order mimic features observed in Snapchat/Instagram. 

To capture media MWCamera has the following functions

```swift
func startRecording() {}

func stopRecording() {}

func cancelRecording() {}

func capturePhoto() {}
```

To be alerted on what's going on set an MWCameraDelegate. For photo capture notifications MWCamera already implements the AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate so you can just override those functions. Please make sure to call super in order keep MWCamera functioning correctly.

**One More Thing!**

MWCameraButton is a throw in view that makes setting up an instagram/snapchat camera app even easier. Just three lines:

```swift
let captureButton = MWCameraButton()
self.register(captureButton)
view.addSubview(captureButton)
```
